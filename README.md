**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

I created the EventTracker app to address the user's need for seamless organization and tracking of daily events. It aimed to provide a user-friendly platform that allows individuals to effortlessly manage event details, schedules, and updates in one place. The goal was to enhance the overall event experience by offering a centralized hub for information and interaction.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The app featured screens for edit event, view event, notification, and account authentcationand. Key features included personalized schedules, SMS notifications, and easy editing. The UI designs prioritized simplicity, intuitive navigation, and visually appealing elements to ensure a positive user experience. The design is successful by allowing to quickly and easily navigate through the app. See the event, click on to edit and turn on the notification if wanted. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

The coding process involved utilizing Android Studio and adhering to best practices in Android development guide. I try to maintain a clean, reusable, and organized code. Object-oriented programming principles were applied for modular and scalable code. Future applications could benefit from adopting a similar architecture, leveraging design patterns, and exploring modern frameworks for enhanced efficiency.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I perform integration testing and run the virtual machine with different phone models to ensure functional and robust code. This process is crucial to identify and rectify bugs, validate functionality against specifications, and enhance overall app reliability. Testing revealed areas for optimization, improved error handling, and ensured a stable user experience.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

Innovation was employed during the design phase to address the challenge of presenting a large amount of event information without overwhelming users. The implementation of a seperate view screen for just summarized on event detail's feature offered a solution. This innovation streamlined user interaction, making the app more user friendly.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

The implementation of SMS notifications showcased my skills in handling background tasks and leveraging Android's notification system effectively. This component demonstrated a deep understanding of asynchronous programming, event handling, and user engagement, contributing significantly to the app's overall success.
